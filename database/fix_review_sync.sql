-- Bitversity Review-Rating Synchronization Fix
-- ===============================================
-- This script fixes the mismatch between ratings/total_ratings 
-- and actual reviews in the reviews table by creating placeholder
-- review entries to match the existing aggregated data.

USE bitversity;

-- First, let's see the current state
SELECT 'Current State Analysis' as info;

-- Check books with ratings but no reviews
SELECT 'BOOKS WITH RATINGS BUT NO REVIEWS' as category;
SELECT b.id, b.title, b.rating, b.total_ratings, COALESCE(r.review_count, 0) as actual_reviews
FROM books b 
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT item_id, COUNT(*) as review_count 
    FROM reviews 
    WHERE item_type = 'book' 
    GROUP BY item_id
) r ON b.id = r.item_id
WHERE b.rating > 0 AND COALESCE(r.review_count, 0) = 0
ORDER BY b.total_ratings DESC;

-- Check games with ratings but no reviews
SELECT 'GAMES WITH RATINGS BUT NO REVIEWS' as category;
SELECT g.id, g.title, g.rating, g.total_ratings, COALESCE(r.review_count, 0) as actual_reviews
FROM games g 
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT item_id, COUNT(*) as review_count 
    FROM reviews 
    WHERE item_type = 'game' 
    GROUP BY item_id
) r ON g.id = r.item_id
WHERE g.rating > 0 AND COALESCE(r.review_count, 0) = 0
ORDER BY g.total_ratings DESC;

-- Check projects with ratings but no reviews
SELECT 'PROJECTS WITH RATINGS BUT NO REVIEWS' as category;
SELECT p.id, p.title, p.rating, p.total_ratings, COALESCE(r.review_count, 0) as actual_reviews
FROM projects p 
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT item_id, COUNT(*) as review_count 
    FROM reviews

-- SOLUTION: Create System-Generated Reviews
-- ===============================================
-- We'll create placeholder reviews that represent the 
-- aggregated rating data to maintain data consistency

-- Create a system user for generated reviews if it doesn't exist
